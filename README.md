![Real-Time Dashboard](https://sthreepublicproject.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dashboard.png)

Welcome to the **Real-Time Dashboard** project! This application leverages **Next.js** and **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to deliver dynamic, real-time updates to users. Whether you're building live data feeds, monitoring dashboards, or real-time notifications, this project provides a robust foundation to achieve seamless server-to-client communication.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Streaming:** Utilizes SSE to push live updates from the server to the client without the need for frequent polling.
- **Randomized Update Intervals:** Simulates dynamic data updates at random intervals between 0.5 and 5 seconds.
- **Interactive Client Interface:** Displays incoming data in a structured and user-friendly manner.
- **Graceful Error Handling:** Manages client disconnections and stream closures without crashing the server.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built with Next.js App Router, ensuring compatibility with modern web standards and scalability.
